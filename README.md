# ML-Algorithms
I write several different Machine Learning techniques from scratch in Python, only utilizing Numpy.
These implementations served as educational resources to really understand the core concepts behind the way AI works.
This README will breifly outline each algorithm used and their results. A more detailed report is available for each algorithm in the doc folder.

## Linear Regression: Implementation of the basic linear regression model using gradient descent.




## Logistic Regression: Binary classification using logistic regression with gradient and stochastic descent.




## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Non-parametric classification algorithm using 5-Fold Cross-Validation to determine the best k values.




## Neural Networks: Basic feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers and customizable activation functions.




## K-Means Clustering: Unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data points.
